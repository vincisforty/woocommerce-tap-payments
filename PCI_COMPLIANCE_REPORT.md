**Implementation Evidence:**
```php
$args = array(
    'method' => $method,
    'headers' => array(
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $api_key,
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
    ),
    'sslverify' => true, // SSL verification enforced
);
```

### Requirement 5: Protect all systems against malware
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**
- Plugin follows WordPress security standards
- No file uploads or executable code handling
- Input validation and sanitization implemented

### Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**

**Security Measures Implemented:**
- Input validation using `sanitize_text_field()`, `intval()`, `floatval()`
- Output escaping using `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- SQL injection prevention via `$wpdb->prepare()`
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- CSRF protection via WordPress nonces

### Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**

- Cloud-based tokenization system

### Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**
- Comprehensive logging implemented
- Security event logging added
- Error logging for all API interactions

**Logging Implementation:**
```php
// Security event logging
private function log_security_event($event_type, $details = array()) {
    $log_entry = array(
        'timestamp' => current_time('mysql'),
        'event_type' => $event_type,
        'ip_address' => $this->get_client_ip(),
        'user_agent' => sanitize_text_field($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']),
        'details' => $details
    );
    error_log('TAP_SECURITY: ' . wp_json_encode($log_entry));
}
```

### Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**
- Security analysis completed
- Vulnerability assessment performed
- Testing framework available

### Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security
**Status: ✅ COMPLIANT**
- Security documentation provided
- Best practices implemented
- Regular security reviews recommended

4. **Secure API Integration**: All sensitive operations handled by Tap's secure infrastructure

### Data Flow Security
```
Customer → Tap Secure Payment Page → Token Generation → Plugin (Token Only)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces PCI scope significantly
- Eliminates sensitive data exposure
- Leverages Tap's PCI compliance infrastructure
